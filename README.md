# Tech Intern Project Repository üöÄ

Welcome to the Tech Intern Project repository! This repository contains two projects assigned to me during the internship.

## Calculator Project üßÆ

### Description
The Calculator project involves creating a simple calculator program in Java. The program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, proper input validation has been implemented to handle various scenarios.

### Usage
Follow these instructions to use the Calculator:

1. **Download/Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone or download this repository onto your local machine.

2. **Open the Calculator Project:**
   - Navigate to the Calculator project folder in your preferred Java development environment.

3. **Compile the Code:**
   - Compile the Java code for the calculator using the appropriate commands or options in your development environment.

4. **Run the Calculator:**
   - Execute the compiled program to run the calculator.

5. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**
   - Provide input as prompted by the calculator.
   - Ensure the input is validated to handle different scenarios (e.g., division by zero).

6. **View Results:**
   - Review the output of the calculator, displaying the results of the  operations.

## StudentGradeAnalyzer Project üìä

### Description
The StudentGradeAnalyzer project is aimed at analyzing student grades in a Java program. The program calculates the average grade, identifies the highest and lowest grades, and provides an overall performance summary. Users can input grades and obtain statistical information about the class's performance.

### Usage
Follow these instructions to use the StudentGradeAnalyzer:

1. **Download/Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone or download this repository onto your local machine.

2. **Open the StudentGradeAnalyzer Project:**
   - Navigate to the StudentGradeAnalyzer project folder in your preferred Java development environment.

3. **Compile the Code:**
   - Compile the Java code for the student grade analyzer using the appropriate commands or options in your development environment.

4. **Run the StudentGradeAnalyzer:**
   - Execute the compiled program to run the student grade analyzer.

5. **Input Student Grades:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to input the grades of the students.
   - Ensure that the input is validated to handle different scenarios (e.g., invalid grade values).

6. **View Statistical Information:**
   - Review the output, which include the average grade, highest and lowest grades, and performance summary.
